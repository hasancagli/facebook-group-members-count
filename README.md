# Facebook Bot to Count The Members In a Group

I developed a project that counts all members of a Facebook group. 

The purpose of doing this is some groups in Facebook is showing their member counts. They are just showing their members and if you start counting one by one, it can take days to finish. 

So I developed a Python Bot with Selenium and used this bot to count the members of any group. It shows the results in under a minute.

Firstly, you need to enter the group_id to the code from the link of the Facebook Group, then you can run the code with "python counting.py"
